# Client Requirement Analysis Document

## Project Overview

The client has requested the development of a web application that replicates the core functionalities of LeetCode. The entire development process must be automated using AI, with no manual coding intervention. The project must be completed within a strict timeline of 3 days.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Question List**
   - Display a list of programming questions for users to select from.

2. **Code Editor**
   - Provide an interface for users to write and edit code.

3. **Submission and Scoring**
   - Allow users to submit their code.
   - Automatically execute the submitted code.
   - Score the code based on predefined test cases and provide feedback on pass/fail status.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The application should be responsive and handle multiple users efficiently.

2. **Scalability**
   - The system should be designed to easily add new questions and test cases.

3. **Usability**
   - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Constraints

- **Programming Language**: Any
- **Development Process**: Entirely automated using AI
- **Proof of Process**: Record the entire AI coding process on video

## Risks and Challenges

1. **Time Constraint**
   - Completing the project within 3 days is a significant challenge.

2. **AI Utilization**
   - Ensuring that AI can handle the entire coding process without manual intervention.

3. **Technical Complexity**
   - Developing a robust code execution and scoring system that accurately evaluates user submissions.

## Implementation Plan

### Preparation Phase

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect detailed requirements from the client.
- **Tool Selection**: Identify and set up AI tools suitable for automated code generation.

### Development Phase

- **AI Coding**: Use AI to generate code for each feature.
- **Documentation**: Record the entire process as proof for the client.

### Testing Phase

- **Functional Testing**: Ensure all features work as expected.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the application under load to ensure it meets performance requirements.

### Delivery Phase

- **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of the application.
- **Client Handover**: Deliver the complete product along with the recorded video of the development process.

## Conclusion

This project requires a strategic approach to leverage AI technology effectively within a tight deadline. Detailed planning, risk management, and efficient use of AI tools will be crucial to successfully meet the client's requirements.
